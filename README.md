# Image Comparator

This is a java application I made as a final project for my AP computer science class. At the time, my phone's camera folder was full of images, many of which were near-exact duplicates. I built this program to sort through images, and easily weed out the images that were very close to each other, but maybe not *exact*. When the program starts, the user is presented with a file selection dialog, where they select all of the files that they want to compare. After that, the program sorts through all of the selected images, and looks for images that are close matches. If two images were found to be close matches, the juxtaposed images are presented to the user, and the user is allowed to choose which image they want to keep. There are additional options for the user to keep either both of the shown images, or neither of them. To choose only one image to keep, click on the image.

Along with all of the source code, in the root folder of this repository you'll find [detailed documentation](javadoc) and a compiled .jar version of the project.
